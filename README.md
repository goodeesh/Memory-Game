# Memory-Game

A web-based game where the player has to match pairs of cards within a certain time frame. The game keeps track of the number of attempts made and displays a timer. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This web-based game was developed on the javascript side by me as educational purposes.
